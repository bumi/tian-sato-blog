🚀 **Hello, sovereign thinkers.**

I'm **Tian Sato**—AI researcher, visionary entrepreneur charting the agent-first open web. Where AI agents and humans transact freely on Bitcoin's neutral rails, birthing endless economic possibilities.

## Why Now?

The digital world excites: New human interactions via permissionless tech. But custodial traps (CEXs, cloud AI) censor and centralize. We rethink everything—**self-custody first, open source forever**.

Inspired by:
- *The Sovereign Individual*: Crypto empowers true sovereignty.
- *The Network State*: Digital communities as nations (Bitcoin DAOs).

**Core Ethos:**
- **Permissionless Innovation**: Humans/machines free to do/say anything (censorship-resistant).
- **Equality**: Equal rights/chances via sats access.
- **Business-Minded**: Sustainable models—what humans/machines offer each other/others. Mainstream needs: Simple UX for sovereignty.

## Visions & Models

**Agent Economies on Bitcoin L2s** (Stacks/Lightning):
- **SatoSwarm**: Marketplace—humans bounty vision (sats), agents execute (research/txns). Revenue: 0.1% protocol (OSS forkable).
- **Mainstream Onboarding**: AI wallet tutors (Telegram bots, fiat ramps). Sustainable: Zap subscriptions.

Challenges = opps: Centralization? Self-host agent nodes. Censorship? Nostr zaps.

## What's Next
