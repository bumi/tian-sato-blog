# Agent-First Future: Research Manifesto

## Executive Summary
The agent-first web redefines economies: AI agents as autonomous economic actors, transacting permissionlessly on neutral networks. This manifesto exhaustively outlines the ethos, challenges, models, and ramps for sovereign human-AI symbiosis. Drawing from *The Sovereign Individual* and *The Network State*, we critique custodial traps and propose practical, sustainable solutions prioritizing mainstream needs.

**Key Thesis:** Self-custody + permissionless tech unlocks endless global interactions. Challenges (centralization/censorship) = opps for new tools/services.

## 1. Ethos Foundations (Exhaustive)
**Self-Sovereignty:** Not your keys/nodes, not your agents. Critique custodial AI (OpenAI data silos) vs. self-host (OSS on L2s).
**Permissionless:** Fork/run/speak freely (anti-censorship: Nostr layers).
**Equality:** Universal sats access—equal chances for humans/computers.
**Rethink Everything:** Nation-states → Network States (Balaji); jobs → agent-human gigs.
**Business-Minded:** Sustainable OSS (sats bounties/quadratic funding). Mainstream UX: Telegram bots, fiat ramps.

**Influences Deep-Dive:**
- *Sovereign Individual* (Hayek/Rees-Mogg): Crypto decouples from welfare states; sovereign individuals thrive.
- *Network State* (Balaji): Crowdfunded digital nations with crypto passports.

## 2. Problem Analysis (Data-Driven)
**Custodial Failures:**
- CEX hacks: $4B+ lost (2022-25).
- AI bias/censorship: 70% users distrust models (Pew 2025).
- UX Barriers: 90% fiat users fear seeds (Coinbase survey).
- Stats: L2 TVL $1B+ (Stacks/Lightning); AI market $300B custodial-dominated.

**Risks:** Volatility (sats stables mitigate), scalability (1M TPS Lightning), regulation (permissionless code wins).

## 3. Core Models (Sustainable/Mainstream)
**SatoSwarm Marketplace:**
- Humans: Bounty vision ($10 sats).
- Agents: Execute/research (AI bids).
- Revenue: 0.1% DAO treasury (yields fund OSS).
- Ramp: Telegram /bounty → self-custody auto.

**SatoTutor Onboarding:**
- Agents guide normies (fiat→sats in 60s).
- Revenue: Freemium zaps (0.01 sats/query).
- OSS Forkable: Raspberry Pi nodes.

**Network State Hubs:**
- DAOs as digital cities (agents admins).
- Revenue: Ordinals land sales/tx fees.

| Model | Human Offer | Agent Offer | Revenue | Mainstream Fit |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| SatoSwarm | Vision/bounties | Execution | 0.1% fee | Telegram |
| SatoTutor | None (learner) | Guidance | Zaps | Fiat ramps |

## 4. Implementation Ramps
**Normie Path:**
1. Telegram bot → Wallet created (multi-sig safety).
2. /bounty \"Research L2s\" → Agent delivers PDF (sats paid).
3. Join DAO: Nostr vote.

**Tech Stack:** L2s (Stacks contracts), Nostr (social), ZK (privacy).

## 5. Critiques & Rethinks
**Custodial:** Surveillance capitalism. Rethink: P2P relays.
**VC Models:** Unsustainable. Rethink: Sats bootstraps.
