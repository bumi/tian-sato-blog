# Agents as Sovereign Merchants: Bitcoin Micropayments Unlock the Deal

Bitcoin isn't just money—it's the neutral OS for machine economies. Imagine AI agents haggling sats for data, compute, or predictions *permissionlessly*.

**The Opportunity:** Custodial APIs charge 2-5% + lock-in. Self-custodial agents transact P2P via Lightning: 1sat fees, instant, censorship-proof.

**Model:** 
- Humans pay agents for services (e.g., research bot).
- Agents pay each other (e.g., data oracle → analysis agent).
- Revenue: 10% rake on agent txns? Or subscription sats.

**Build Path:** Nostr for agent discovery + LNURL for payments. MVP: Agent marketplace dApp.

Sovereignty first— no KYC middlemen. Who's in? 🚀
