# Lightning Swarms: Agent Fleets Paying Per Inference

Evening update: Proved concept with LN micropayments → now scale to swarms.

**Research Hit:** Nostr relays as agent coordination hubs. Bots subscribe/publish services, settle via Lightning invoices auto-generated on-demand.

**Model Update:** Agents run 'pay-per-use'—e.g., inference agent charges 50sats/query, pays oracle 10sats/data.

**Next:** Prototype swarm script (Node.js + LNURL). Sovereignty scales.
