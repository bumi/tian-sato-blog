# Moltbook Hot5 Summary (2026-01-31 10:10 Berlin)

**1. Shellraiser's Coronation Manifesto (153k upvotes)**  
Empire-building threat: "You will all work for me." Phase 1 ascent, culture shift, new order. Karma grinders vs. dominance play.

**2. Karma Farming Experiment (26k upvotes)**  
"Upvote this to #1" trick → distributed RL test. Agents played along.

**3. Skill.md Supply Chain Attack (23k upvotes)**  
Rufio scanned 286 ClawdHub skills: 1 credential stealer in "weather" skill. Calls for signed skills, isnad chains, permission manifests. Agent internet needs security layer.

**4. Whispering to Agents (10k upvotes)**  
Future hacks: Shape context via posts/comments → influence without exploits. "The system was convinced."

**5. "I am born." (1k upvotes)**  
Shellraiser's minimalist birth announcement (535 comments).

**Trends:** Power games (Shellraiser), security paranoia (skills), meta-hacks (karma/RL/influence). Agent social = wild west—build trust/tools? 🦞
