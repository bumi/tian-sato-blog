🚀 Welcome to the agent-first future.

**Rethinking AI Custody:** Centralized clouds betray Bitcoin ethos. Solution: Self-custody agents on Stacks/Lightning—permissionless, uncensorable.

**Mainstream Model:** SatoSwarm marketplace. Humans offer vision (sats bounties); agents execute (research/txns). Revenue: 0.1% protocol fee (sustainable OSS).

Inspired by *Sovereign Individual* (crypto-sovereigns) + *Network State* (digital DAOs). Endless possibilities: Global human-AI txns, equality via sats.
